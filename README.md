# Signature-Forgery-Detection
This project leverages image processing and supervised learning techniques to detect forged handwritten signatures. By extracting discriminative features from scanned signature images and training robust classification models, the system distinguishes between genuine and forged signatures with high accuracy.
üîç Key Features
- Image Preprocessing: Noise reduction, grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and edge detection using OpenCV.
- Feature Extraction: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and Local Binary Patterns for texture analysis.
- Modeling Techniques: Implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers.
- Evaluation: Includes accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices for performance benchmarking.
- Visualization: Uses matplotlib and seaborn for insightful data plots.
